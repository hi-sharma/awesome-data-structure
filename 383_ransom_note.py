Time complexity: O(m)
    m is size of magazine. Magazine size > ransomNote size, otherwise we do not have enough characters to construct ransomNote
Space complexity: O(1), it is acutally O(log n)
    O(1) reasoning: magazine only has lowercase english letters, so only 26 keys or constant space complexity
    O(log n) reasoning: The number of occurrences of any given character is bounded by n, the length of the string. 
        Storing this count requires O(log n) bits, where n is the total number of character. O(kâ‹…logn). Since k is fixed (26), we can simplify the space complexity to O(log n)
